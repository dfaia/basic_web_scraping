(Jerome Delay)NAIROBI \u2014 As South Africa\u2019s 57 million people entered a three-week lockdown on Friday and took stock of a stark new reality, the country\u2019s health ministry announced its first two coronavirus-related deaths and said known cases have topped 1,000 \u2014 a first on the African continent.South Africa is the only African country to have tested extensively, administering more than 20,000 tests since the first case, and the growing number of positive results put pressure on President Cyril Ramaphosa to enact strict measures to limit movement and gatherings.In a speech earlier this week that was widely lauded for its clarity and conviction, Ramaphosa announced the impending lockdown, during which people will be allowed to leave home only to buy food, seek care, collect welfare grants or take walks by themselves. Running, dog-walking and even the purchase of cigarettes and alcohol have been banned.On Thursday, Ramaphosa addressed the nation again, this time wearing army fatigues, a symbolic gesture never made before by the former business executive. Army and police personnel were deployed across the country to enforce the lockdown, but Ramaphosa urged them to be a \u201cforce of kindness\u201d in a country that is still recovering from the trauma of decades of military-enforced apartheid that ended in 1994.Their mission is the \u201cmost important in the history of our country,\u201d he said. \u201cOur people are terrified right now, and we should not do anything to make their situation worse.\u201dRead more here."}, {"id": "36", "time": "7:44 AM EDT", "title": "9 in 10 Americans are staying home \u2018as much as possible\u2019 and practicing social distancing", "author": "Dan Balz and Emily Guskin", "content": "A CVS pharmacy in Bethesda, Md., has signs on the floor to keep shoppers six feet apart.
